# AI
These are my implementations for each of the AI programming assignments.
Dijkstra and Knights Isolation are based in code provided by my instructor Kamil Samara
The Final project, PacmanProblems, is provided by https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp23/projects/
I only implemented code in search.py and searchAgents.py as was recommended in linked instructions.
